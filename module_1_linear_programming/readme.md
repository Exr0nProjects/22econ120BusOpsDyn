# casting chebyschev distance as a linear optimization problem
1. Frame it as a linear programming problem
2. We can use a piecewise convex objective, and a maximum of distances is piecewise convex
3. Find the distance to each hyperplane by scaling a normal vector
4. Normal can be found using the standard equation for an m-hyperplane
